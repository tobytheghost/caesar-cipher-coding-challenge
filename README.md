# Frontend coding challenge

For this challenge we would like you to create a Caesar Cipher. You will create an input, which will take any string and apply the cipher, then display the results below.

In a Caesar cipher, you can specify the 'shift' and direction of the substitution. Bonus points if your solution allows these to be updated in the UI.

## Getting started

Open a terminal and run `npm run start`
A second terminal can be opened to run tests: `npm run test`

## The rules

- No libraries please
- The solution should come with unit tests
- All code should be typed
- Expected time should be 45mins

Please save your results and send the link back to us when you are happy!
